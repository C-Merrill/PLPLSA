                    <p>
                        Protext, a publicly traded company (TXTM), owns and operates two wholly owned subsidiaries: Plandai Biotechnology South Africa and Cannabis Biosciences

                    <h3>About Plandai Biotechnology South Africa</h3>
                    <p>
                        Plandai Biotechnology South Africa is engaged in the research and clinical testing of “bioceutical” products—all natural ingredients formulated for pharmaceutical applications and processed under pharma-grade conditions. The Company has the exclusive worldwide license to develop pharmaceutical applications and products using the Phytofare® catechin complex, which was developed by Plandaí Biotechnology, Inc.  Phytofare® is a highly bioavailable extract produced from live green tea leaves. Our initial product, Phytofare® Catechin Complex, has been clinically shown to have 10 times greater bioavailability over generic catechin extracts. What this means is that Phytofare® can deliver a therapeutic level of catechins, which function as powerful antioxidants, to the system where they remain active for over 24 hours. Plandaí grows green tea on its 7,500 acre Senteeko estate in South Africa, where it produces the proprietary Phytofare® catechin extract in-house, allowing the Company a continuity of supply as well as quality control throughout the entire process. Targeted applications for the Company's products include arthritis, inflammation, anti-viral, and diabetes-related metabolic syndromes.

                    <h3>About Cannabis Biosciences</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cannabis Biosciences is focused on developing cannabis extracts under legal government licenses and permits which the Company is currently pursuing. Using proprietary processing and extraction technology developed by Plandaí Biotechnology, Inc, the company intends to commence investigations in conjunction with independent researchers to establish whether it can produce a full-profile cannabis extract, one that contains both CBD and the precursor acid form of THC (THC-A and THC-B) found in live cannabis plant. The hypothesis is that the resultant extract will have the superior bioavailability of other Phytofare® extracts with the added benefit of being non-psychoactive. Several third-party investigations have shown that the precursor acid forms THC-A and THC-B in live cannabis leaf are inherently non-psychoactive and that the process of drying and heating the leaf metabolizes these acid forms into THC, a chemical that triggers the euphoria sought after by recreational users.  The Company’s investigations will be designed to show that the Cannabis Biosciences extraction process, which will use live leaf and low temperatures to extract the phyto-chemicals, should leave the acid forms of THC intact, resulting in a non-psychoactive extract with full medicinal potential.
