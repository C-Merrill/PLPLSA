                    <p>
                        Plandaí Biotechnology South Africa (Pty) Ltd, recently acquired by Protext Mobility, Inc.(OTCPINK: TXTM) is a South Africa-based research company focusing on the development of pharmaceutical applications for botanical drugs. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plandaí South Africa has the worldwide exclusive license to develop Phytofare® in botanical drug applications. Phytofare® is a highly bioavailable extract produced from live green tea leaves that has been clinically proven in double-blind human trials to have ten-times greater bioavailability over generic extract. What this means is that Phytofare® can deliver a therapeutic level of catechins to the system where they remain active for over 24 hours. The Company plans to commence human clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of using Phytofare® catechin complex in regulating insulin levels in Type II Diabetes patients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Diabetes is now the leading cause of death in South Africa and the rates are only climbing through much of sub-Sahara Africa and the developing world where fat-rich foods have supplanted traditional diets. There is a strong body of scientific research that points to the effectiveness of green tea catechins in managing obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and other diet-related diseases. Data from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that green tea catechins, in particularly EGCG, exert anti-obesity effects via several mechanisms including inhibition of adipocyte differentiation and proliferation, reduction of fat absorption, and the reduction in fat mass, tricylglycerides, free fatty acids and total cholesterol. The majority of human intervention studies investigating glucose homeostasis further demonstrate improved glucose levels in response to green tea catechins. Human studies have shown anti-obesity, anti-diabetic and cardio-protective effects of green tea catechins <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">(1)</a></sup>.

                    <p>
                        However, as we all know, like many botanical ingredients green tea is poorly absorbed into the blood stream, rendering it an ineffective primary control therapy. Phytofare®, on the other hand, which has ten-times greater absorption, may very well provide an inexpensive, all-natural solution to these diseases. Our clinical trial is designed to build on this prior research and show the benefits of Phytofare® in managing glucose levels, with a short-term goal of having a consumer-ready capsule product by Q4, 2017.

                        Worldwide as of 2015, 415 million people had diabetes, with the number growing to over 642 million people in 2016, with Type II Diabetes making up about 90% of the cases. In 2014, the IDF estimated that diabetes resulted in 4.9 million annual deaths.
