    Protext Mobility, Inc. through its wholly owned subsidiary Plandai Biotechnology South Africa is a biotech company engaged in the development of pharmaceutical applications for the highly bioavailable Phytofare® catechin complex (Phytofare®). Phytofare®, the Company’s main product, is a highly-bioavailable extract produced from live green tea leaves. Phytofare® carries distinctly unique properties over traditional green tea extracts, which is accomplished through a proprietary manufacturing process using live plants that enter the production facility within an hour of being harvested. Through this production process, Phytofare® as an end product contains all eight catechins (antioxidants) found in green tea and has been clinically researched to be efficiently transferred into the blood plasma, where the catechins have remained for more than 24 hours. Additionally, Phytofare® has 10x the bioavailability over traditionally consumed green tea resulting in a daily dosage that can deliver a therapeutic amount of catechins<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">(1)</a></sup>. In looking for a natural solution, epidemiological evidences indicate that populations with a high intake of green tea catechins benefit in terms of body weight, body fat, the balance of insulin and glucagon, maintaining blood glucose, and cardiovascular health<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">(2)</a></sup>.

    Type II Diabetes is a long-term metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin, that is partly preventable by maintaining a normal weight, exercising regularly, and eating properly through dietary changes. Diabetes has now become a leading health issue in USA, with a population of 318 million, 70% of whom are overweight and 9% are diabetic. Worldwide as of 2015, 415 million people had diabetes, with the number growing to over 642 million people in 2016, with Type II Diabetes making up about 90% of the cases. In 2014, the IDF estimated that diabetes resulted in 4.9 million annual deaths<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">(3)</a></sup>. Protext plans to address this epidemic by bringing to market various products in a capsule formulation of highly biovalable Phytofare®, containing the full spectrum of all 8 green tea catachins.

    Diabetes is now a leading cause of death around the world where fat-rich foods have supplanted traditional diets. There is a strong body of scientific research that points to the effectiveness of green tea catechins, in managing obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and other diet-related diseases. However, like many botanical ingredients, green tea is poorly absorbed into the blood stream, rendering it an ineffective primary control therapy. Phytofare®, on the other hand, which has ten-times greater absorption (bioavailability), may very well provide a cost effective, all-natural solution to these diseases. Our immediate objective is to build on this prior research through a forthcoming clinical trial, and confirm the benefits of Phytofare® in managing glucose levels and other diabetic markers. Over the next quarter the Company anticipates having various consumer-ready Phytofare® catechin complex-based products in capsule form for sale, with a near-term goal of obtaining an FDA clearance to market its Phytofare® with a diabetes claim.
